// APEX SENTINEL — UNIFIED SIGNAL STATE (translation layer only).
//
// REFINEMENT 1 + 2 + 4.
//
// This module DOES NOT compute anything new. Every underlying engine keeps its
// own vocabulary and its own maths:
//
//   EntryPointStatus   (entry-point.ts)
//   EntryVerdict       (entry-clearance.ts)
//   SetupGrade         (setup.ts)
//   RelativeEdgeLabel  (relative-edge.ts)
//
// It only normalises those existing states into ONE presentation vocabulary so
// the UI stops having to interpret four enums at once:
//
//   STRONG · VALID · WATCH · EXPLORATORY · BLOCKED
//
// plus the explicit REFINEMENT 2 sub-state "VALID — WAIT FOR ENTRY": the market
// and contract qualify, but the Entry-Point Engine has not validated a digit.
// In that case the entry digit is reported as WAIT. It is never fabricated.
